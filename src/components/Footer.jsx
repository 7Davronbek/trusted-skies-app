                                *All the fares displayed are in USD and include all taxes, fees and applicable surcharges. All prices are 'from' per person, based on business class weekday travel (Monday - Thursday) from the USA, and depend on the chosen class of service, departure city, airline and the route. Lowest transatlantic fares are usually from the East Coast; transpacific fares - from the West Coast. SkyLux Travel is not able to identify some travel partners or itinerary details online so as not to directly compete with regular retail sales of the travel partner. Savings up to 77% off are indicated of the full un-restricted published airfares of major airlines and may vary based on individual fare rules. Some airlines may impose additional baggage charges. The fares are subject to seat availability in the corresponding booking inventory. Seats are limited and may not be available on all flights and dates. The fares have flexible booking policy: free exchange and/or cancelation is available now with our partner airlines. In the event of trip cancelation, unless otherwise stated, customers will retain travel credit with the issuing airline for one year, excluding airline fees. In the event of exchange, fare difference may apply. The fares and their governing rules are subject to change without prior notice. Other restrictions may apply. Additional $200 referral discounts apply as follows: referring customers receive $100 in their SkyLuxTravel account for every new customer who gets a discount using their referral code, and referred customers get a $100 discount on their first eligible purchase.
